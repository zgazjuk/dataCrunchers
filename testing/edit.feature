Edit a project/task

As a user, I want to be able to edit a project/task that I previously created
to better represent my specific goals/ideas.

I will know that this story is complete when:
- A project/task can be clicked, where the detailed information can be viewed
- Once the detailed information can be viewed, it can be modified with new
information
- The new information can then be saved and is accurately reflected when the
ticket is viewed after
