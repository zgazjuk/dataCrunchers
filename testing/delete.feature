Delete a project/task

As a user, I want to be able to delete a project/task from my board if it is no
longer relevant to my goals.

I will know that this story is complete when:
- A project/task can be viewed, where it can then be deleted by a two-step
process
- Example: Click delete (1) -> Message appears asking to confirm deletion (2)
